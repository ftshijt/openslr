Multilingual TEDx is a multilingual speech recognition and translation corpus to facilitate the training of ASR and SLT models in additional languages.

<p>
  The corpus comprises audio recordings and transcripts from TEDx Talks in 8 languages (Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Greek, Arabic, German) with translations into up to 5 languages (English, Spanish, French, Portguese, Italian). 
  The audio recordings are automatically aligned at the sentence level with their manual transcriptions and translations.
  
  Each .tgz file contains two directories: data and docs. Docs contains a README detailing the provided files and their structure.
